# 📁 GitHub Upload Guide - Split into Parts

Since GitHub has a 100-file upload limit, we've split your study planner into 3 parts.

## 🎯 **Upload Order:**

### **Part 1: Core App Files (52 files)**
- **Folder**: `study-planner-part1`
- **Contains**: Main app files, pages, API routes, configuration
- **Upload first** - This is the foundation

### **Part 2: UI Components (94 files)**
- **Folder**: `study-planner-part2`
- **Contains**: All React components, UI library, styling
- **Upload second** - After core files are in place

### **Part 3: Supporting Files (82 files)**
- **Folder**: `study-planner-part3`
- **Contains**: Hooks, utilities, tests, documentation, assets
- **Upload last** - Final touches
